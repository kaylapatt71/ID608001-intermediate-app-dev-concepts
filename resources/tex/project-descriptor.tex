\section{Part 2}

\textbf{Scenario:} Due to a nation-wide lockdown, your local pub is no longer able to run their weekly quiz night onsite. Your local pub owners know you are an IT student and ask if you want create an online quiz night application for them. For the first step, the pub owners want a \textbf{RESTful API} that provides various functions for registering, logging in, participating in various quizzes and keeping track of scores so that they can give away prizes at the end of each quiz night.

\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcomes 1 and 2 (50\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You will have \textbf{two} types of users - \textbf{super admin} and \textbf{basic} user.
		\item A \textbf{super admin} and \textbf{basic} user will have the following information: first name, last name, username, email address, profile picture, password, confirm password and role. The users' profile picture will be from the following \textbf{API} - \href{https://avatars.dicebear.com/docs/http-api}{https://avatars.dicebear.com/docs/http-api}. Each profile picture should be, in most cases, different. I suggest using a random seed when setting the user's profile picture.
		\item A \textbf{super admin} and \textbf{basic} user can login, get their information and update their information but not delete themselves. A \textbf{super admin} user can get all users' information, update all \textbf{basic} users' information but not \textbf{super admin} user's information and delete all \textbf{basic} users but not \textbf{super admin} users. A \textbf{basic} user can register.
		\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for registering a \textbf{basic} user, the following error checking needs to be implemented using \textbf{Joi}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item First name has a minimum length of two characters, a maximum length of 50 characters and alpha characters only.
			\item Last name has the same error checking as first name above.
			\item Username is unique, has a minimum length of five characters, maximum length of ten characters and alphanumeric characters only, i.e., johndoe123.
			\item Email address is unique, contains the username above, an @ special character and a second-level domain, i.e., johndoe123@email.com.
			\item Password has a minimum length of eight characters, maximum length of 16 characters and contains one numeric character and one special character.
			\item Confirm password is the same as the password above. \textbf{Note:} Confirm password will not be a field in the \textbf{User} table. Rather, it will be used to validate the user's password.
		\end{itemize}
		For each error check, a status code and response message is returned, i.e., "First name must have a minimum length of two characters".
		\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for logging in a user using either username/password or email address/password, return a status code, a response message, i.e., "$<$User's username$>$ has successfully logged in" and the user's \textbf{JWT}.
		\item When performing a \textbf{PUT} and \textbf{DELETE} request, return a status code and a response message, i.e., "$<$User's username$>$'s information has successfully updated" or "$<$User's username$>$ has successfully deleted".
		\item Five \textbf{super admin} users are seeded via a \textbf{script} in the \textbf{package.json} file. The \textbf{super admin} users' data will be fetched from a local file and inserted into the \textbf{User} table using \textbf{Prisma}.  
		\item Five \textbf{basic} users are seeded via a \textbf{super admin} user. The \textbf{basic} users' data will be fetched from a private \textbf{GitHub Gist} using \textbf{Axios} and inserted into the \textbf{User} table using \textbf{Prisma}. 
	\end{itemize} 
	\item \textbf{Quiz:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each quiz will have the following information: name, start date, end date, category, difficulty, type, number of questions, list of questions, list of correct answers, list of incorrect answers, list of scores, average score and overall winner. The category, list of questions, list of correct answers and list of incorrect answers will be fetched from the following \textbf{API} - \href{https://opentdb.com/api\_config.php}{https://opentdb.com/api\_config.php}. The difficulties will be easy, medium and hard. The types will be multiple choice or true/false.
		\item A \textbf{super admin} and \textbf{basic} user can get all quizzes, get all past quizzes, get all present quizzes, get all future quizzes and get a list of scores . A \textbf{super admin} user can create and delete a quiz. A \textbf{basic} user can participate in a quiz only once.
		\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for creating a quiz, the following error checking needs to be implemented using \textbf{Joi}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Name has a minimum length of five characters, a maximum length of 30 characters and alpha characters only.
			\item Start date has to be greater than or equal to today's date.
			\item End date has to be greater than the start date and no longer than five days. 
			\item Number of questions has to be ten.
		\end{itemize}
		For each error check, a status code and response message is returned, i.e., "Name must have a minimum length of five characters".
		\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for a \textbf{basic} user who is participating in a quiz, the following error checking needs to be implemented using \textbf{Joi}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Can not participate if quiz has not started or has ended.
			\item Answered all ten questions.
		\end{itemize}
		\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for a \textbf{basic} user who has participated in a quiz, return a status code, a response message, i.e., "$<$User's username$>$ has successfully participated in $<$Quiz's name$>$", user's score and quiz's average score.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{HTTP:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Headers are secured using \textbf{Helmet}.
